# Spring REST Docs sample app

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how to document an API implemented with Spring Framework using [Spring REST Docs](https://projects.spring.io/spring-restdocs/).

## How does it works?

The project is built with `gradle` so in order to generate the documentation, just run:

> ./gradlew clean build

Then go to the `build/asciidoc/html5` folder and open the `index.html` file with a browser of your choice. Voil√†!
